## User Story
As a user with a passionate interest in Comet's and anything galaxy related. I want to be able to select a date of choice then view a list of near Earth objects with interesting facts. When the date is chosen, a fascinating image will be displayed for each day!

## Expected Behaviour
1. User can select a date using the on screen form 
2. A list of near earth objects for chosen date is generated and displayed in the table with facts  
3. Local storage is utilised by storing previous dates selected
4. Astronomy picture of the day selected is displayed on the front page

## Installation
To get our project running, we used 2 APIs from NASA. First API is called **NeoWs**, which stands for **"Near Earth Object Web Service".** This API provided all the Asteroid's data in our web page based on a date the user selects.

To ensure **Comet Watch** was appealing to our users we implemented the use of a second API called **APOD - Astronomy Picture of the Day API.** This generates a random image based on the date the user has chosen which is incorporated into a fixed image carousel.
